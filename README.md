# Hello, I'm Oshanik!

 - 🧑🏻‍💻 I'm a backend engineer based in New Delhi, currently working with **Java, Python, Shell scripts, and the Cloud**. I've been writing Java since I was in high school.
 - 🚪 I'm working on my own little side project called "Opendoor", soon to be launched on the App Store and Google Play Store
 - 🎭 I built an app that connects Event Managers with people who want to organise an event, check it out - https://github.com/Oshanik22/Eventia-Pro
 - ☁️ I'm learning the Cloud at the moment
 - 🎯 I'm currently on the lookout for backend development roles in Java or Python. I'd especially like to work with startups that are building the next-big-thing in tech, where I can have an impact on the world. If you're hiring, lets chat!

# Hello, I'm Oshanik!

 - I'm a backend engineer based in New Delhi, currently working with Java, Python, Shell scripts, and the Cloud. I've been writing Java since I was in high school.
 - I'm working on my own little side project called "Opendoor", soon to be launched on the App Store and Google Play Store
 - I'm learning about the Cloud at the moment
 - I'm currently on the lookout for backend development roles in Java or Python. I'd especially like to work with startups that are building the next-big-thing in tech, where I can have an impact on the world. If you're hiring, lets chat!
